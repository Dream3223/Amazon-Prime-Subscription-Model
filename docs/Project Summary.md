## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Rows with missing values were removed to ensure data integrity.
2. **Feature Encoding**: Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding and others encoded ordinally.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to understand the distribution and relationships within the data. Key insights include:
- Distribution of gender, favorite genres, and usage frequency.
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between features.

### Model Development

Three machine learning models were developed and evaluated:

1. **Decision Tree Classifier**
2. **Random Forest Classifier** (Non-Tuned and Tuned)
3. **XGBoost Classifier**

### Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using F1 score, recall, precision, and accuracy metrics. The results are as follows:

| **Model**              | **F1**    | **Recall** | **Precision** | **Accuracy** |
|------------------------|-----------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| Decision Tree          | 0.546140  | 0.582330   | 0.514180      | 0.518000     |
| Random Forest (Non-Tuned) | 0.536650  | 0.521630   | 0.552560      | 0.528000     |
| Random Forest (Tuned)    | 0.547655  | 0.555215   | 0.540299      | 0.521600     |
| XGBoost                | 0.483871  | 0.501672   | 0.505600      | 0.492611     |

### Cross-Validation

Cross-validation was performed to ensure model robustness. The cross-validation accuracy was approximately 51.36% with a standard deviation of Â±2.14%.

## Key Findings

1. **Model Selection**: The Decision Tree Classifier was selected as the final model due to its higher accuracy, recall, and precision, making it the most balanced and interpretable model.
2. **Feature Importance**: Important features identified included usage frequency, engagement metrics, and renewal status.
3. **Recommendations**: Focus on improving engagement and providing incentives for manual renewal users to switch to automatic renewal to increase annual subscriptions.

## Conclusion

The predictive model provides valuable insights into the factors influencing subscription plan choices. Although the accuracy could be improved with a larger dataset, the current model offers actionable insights for enhancing customer retention strategies.

## Future Work

- **Data Enrichment**: Collect more data to improve model accuracy and generalization.
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features and interactions to enhance model performance.
- **Advanced Models**: Experiment with advanced machine learning techniques and ensemble methods.
